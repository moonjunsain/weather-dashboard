## Description 
This is a product of a challenge provided by UC Berkeley Extension Coding Bootcamp

This is for displaying weather dashboard.
It has input areas for the city the user want to search for. 
The user can find the search result in the card on the right, the current day weather and 5 day forecast for that city.

This was done while trying to accomplish following criteria:

### Acceptance Criteria
    - GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
    1. WHEN I search for a city
    THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
    2. WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
    THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
    3. WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
    THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

## Usage 

Following is the demo of this app.
The user can search a city name in the input, and when the user clicks the search button, it displays current weather for that city followed by 5 day forecast for that city. The search history gets saved (no duplicate) to the local storage, and the user can click the history to get back the result. The user can also clear the history, and convert temperature units to celsius or fahrenheit
